- 👋 Hi, I’m @BreeBaugh

- 👀 I love working with computers, film, post-production, snowboarding, music/music production, books (namely science fiction), history and TV shows
that aren't terrible by the 5th season.

- 🌱 My academics are focused on Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. They all pretty much blend together but I have to make
it sound cool.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I need the experience, put me to work!

- 📫 How to reach me:
Email: bree.baugh@protonmail.com
