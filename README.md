- 👋 Hi, I’m @BreeBaugh

- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things! I love computers, snowboarding, music/music production, books (+1 for fantasy), history and TV shows
that aren't terrible by the 5th season. I'm also the only Millennial I know that willingly eats at Arby's. That's gotta count for something, yeah? 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science, math, statistics, and data science. They all pretty much blend together but I have to make
it sound cool.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I need the experience, put me to work!

- 📫 How to reach me:
